First, I always check PE file info with CFF Explorer

![File info]({{site.url}}/assets/whre01_file_info.PNG)

I will check Import Directory to know Imported functions.

Next step, I run file

![Run file]({{site.url}}/assets/wh2018re01_run_file.PNG)

I type a test key and click ```check``` button but there is nothing ~.~

Because ```re01``` is GUI program, so I use ```resource hacker``` to check resource file.

![Resource]({{site.url}}/assets/wh2018re01_resource.PNG)

I found some Dialog, exe, dll file and ...

Next load to ```IDA``` and I see

![Code]({{site.url}}/assets/wh2018re01_extract.PNG)

It extract 2 resoureces and write into 2 files ```b.dll``` and ```2.exe``` after that. I run ```2.exe``` file

OK, Let's dump ```2.exe``` and ```b.dll``` file with resourceId: 141, 142

```2.exe``` is PE file, so I load it to ```IDA```

But ```b.dll``` is data file, Maybe it was encrypted.

When I load ```2.exe``` into ```IDA``` I see

![2.exe]({{site.url}}/assets/wh2018re01_2.exe.PNG)

```2.exe``` get command from ```WhiteHat.exe``` and decrypt ```b.dll`` file.

Because ```v12``` variable  is ```char``` and I'm too lazy to find ```v14``` and ```v16``` so maybe I will bruteforce from 0 to 255 to file ```b.dll```

Lucky me!! I think ```b.dll``` is PE file(but not true), so I decided assign ```v12=0```, because many bytes in PE file is 0

After that. I found ```v12 = 0x36```

Decrypt ```b.dll``` I found a PNG file with flag

![PNG file]({{site.url}}/assets/wh2018re01_PNG_file.PNG)

rename and open file

![Flag]({{site.url}}/assets/wh2018re01_flag.PNG)

Flag is: ```today is good day```

Hash it and submit!!! :joy: :joy:
